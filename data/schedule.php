We’ll learn what a “framework” really is as we create our own using components from Symfony, Zend Framework, and Lithium. When you leave, you’ll understand how to use a PSR-0 autoloader to bring new libraries into your app, how a dependency injection container can help you, and what’s really going on under the surface of the popular frameworks and CMS libraries.',

In this tutorial, I will briefly go through some of the whys of having an API and what one would want to be exposing before we go into depth on creating and exposing these APIs. Using real world scenarios we will explore creating APIs with different data formats, ways to expose them as well as how to deal with debugging when things go wrong. In addition to the creation, understanding and being able to write consumers is also a critical skill when developing APIs. We will cover this not only as part of debugging, but also when working on and discussing different consumer types such as mobile applications.',
